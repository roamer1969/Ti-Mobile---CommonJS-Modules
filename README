Welcome to my cross platforms (iOS, Android) app development project with Titanium Mobile.

This is a simple "Event Calendar" project to demonstrade best mobile JavaScript programing pratices using CommonJS Modules. 

* object-oriented programing using CommonJS modules mechanism to create self-contained modules.

* structuring code with commonJS modules do more than just packaging your app with namespacing. 
It also helps you to organize your code, not polluting the global scope, and define your modules dependencies, all of which are not enforced in normal namespacing. 

* develop secure and reusable JavaScript code.


Implementation
--------------
app.js starting point of the app. Use this file to bootstrap Javascript modules

ui/win.js  user interphase windows, views etc

modules/db.js  handles all local SQLlite database interaction (create tables, insert, select, update, delete)

modules/network.js handles network communication
